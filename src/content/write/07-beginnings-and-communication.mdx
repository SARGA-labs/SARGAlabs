## Beginnings

There is a difference between responsibility
and accountability.

Everything connects back to communication.

Everything needs a beginning.

I learned this watching something simple.
A friendship is often the best start.

You cannot build a future
while gripping the past.

Let things begin again.
Let them move through phases.

I choose comfort over convenience.

## Healing

Positive change matters
because comfort makes us stagnant.

Starting over is not failure.
It is recovery.

You cannot heal what you refuse to face.
What stays hidden repeats.

Life moves in cycles.
Awareness breaks them.

Love yourself without conditions.
Only then can love extend outward.

If it is not in your control,
it does not deserve space in your mind.

Everywhere I walk becomes my path.
If I write my story,
I cannot be wrong.

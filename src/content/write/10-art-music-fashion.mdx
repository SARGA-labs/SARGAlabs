## Art, Music, Fashion

Art, music, and fashion evolve constantly.
I am glad to exist inside that motion.

They are not luxuries.
They are secondary needs,
as vital as language.

These mediums define eras.

I am still learning.
That is enough.

The question is simple.
What are you doing differently
in the fields you care about?

I am experimenting.
Observing.
Asking.

If you have thoughts,
reach out.

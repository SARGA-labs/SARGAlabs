## Colors and Perception

How does a blind person imagine color?
Not as shades, but as form. Objects appear as outlines or solid masses.

Black changes when it burns.
It becomes ash, smoke, absence.
So what color is black when it is burnt?

Skin color is not a tone.
It is history, exposure, geography, light.

Color is personal.
I see color through memory, emotion, and sound.

There is a song about color I return to.
Donovan reminds me that color can feel soft.

A smaller brush leaves less room for error.
Precision reduces regret.

What happens if we swap black and white?
Do meanings flip, or do we?

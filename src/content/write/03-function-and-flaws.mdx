## What I Do and Why

I am clumsy.
I fail in visible ways.

I call myself ugly,
yet people love me first,
then turn away.

I struggle to keep relationships alive.
Not from lack of care,
but from lack of balance.

I resent people from where I come from,
yet I want to build something for my origins.

Contradiction is part of me.

## Creativity

Creativity is not talent.
It is a way of operating.

You build creativity through movement.
Through practice.
Through friction.

Your logic may stop making sense.
That does not mean it is wrong.

Being creative is not rare.
It is expressive.

Originality is optional.
Claiming an idea as your own is also creative.

Even pretending to be creative
can unlock the real thing.

Creativity sparks everywhere.
It comes to you when you are open.

Creativity is not a destination.
It is a condition.
